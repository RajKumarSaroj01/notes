K8

What problem solves
- Provides small independent host for microservices
- utilization of worker node, we can host multiple pods on one node ,not necessary all pods will use 100% hardware in any particular time
- High availability
- Scalability
- Disaster recovery


Components
- volumes: external disk attached to pods to store the data, it could be local disk or reference of remote disk
- Pod : smallest unit of K8, abstraction over container , each pods gets own IP(private) address and pods communicates through that  
- service : it's basically a static ip attached to pods, generally if the pod goes down then on recreation a new ip address gets assigned to it , if we attach the service to the pod then ip will be the same . Lifecycle of pod and service are not the same means service will be there even if the pod goes down.
permanent address with DNS , also a load balancer
- Ingress: Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.

- Secrets : just like ConfigMap, but stores the configuration in base64 encoded format, best suited for storing DB credentials
- ConfigMap : external configuration of application like DB endpoint
- StatefulSet
- Deployment
